The Privacy Act 1988 (Privacy Act): 

The Privacy Act is a legislative framework regulating how the Australian Government Agencies (not state/teritory) & private sector organisations with annual turnover upward of $3m handle personal information.

The purpose of the Privacy Act is to promote the protection of individual privacy, as well as regulating the privacy component of the consumer credit reporting system, tax file numbers as well as health and medical research.

The Privacy Act 1988 is composed around 13 Australian Privacy Principles (APPs), they include:

1. Open & Transparent Management of Personal Information

2. Anonymitity & Pseudonymity

3. Collection of Solicited Personal Information

4. Dealing With Unsolicited Personal Information

5. Notification of the Collection of Personal Information

***Q2. CASE STUDY***

***Bonza IT provides an online booking service with an annual turnover of $5 Million. They provide their service via the internet and customers pay for bookings by using their credit cards. Bonza IT maintains a database of the customer's credit card and personal details. The database that Bonza IT uses is not secure and anyone can access it. Bonza IT does not have a privacy policy or a data protection policy.***

***Recently, Bonza IT suffered a cyberattack and credit card and customer details were removed.***

***After reading the case study, briefly describe the legal obligations that Bonza IT have breached? The answer should be between 50-100 words.***

1. Breach of the Privacy Policy Act 1988 - APP Act 11: Security of personal information.

As a private sector organisation that has an annual turnover upward of $3M, they have a responsibilty to ensure security of personal information it holds. As they did not have a Privacy or Data Protection Policy in place, they are breaching the APP Act 11.

Since the Privacy Legislation Amendment (Enforcement and Other Measures) Bill 2022, The maximum penalty of serious or repeated privacy breaches, the maximum penalty has been raised from $2.22M to (whichever is greater of:

$50 million;
three times the value of any benefit obtained through the misuse of information; or
30 per cent of a company's adjusted turnover in the relevant period.

***Q3. Briefly explain the following legislation (with reference to cyber security):***

- ***Cybercrime Act 2001 (Australia)***
- ***Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act ( United States of America)***
- ***General Data Protection Regulation (European Union)***

1. The Cyber Crime Act 2001 (Australia):

Defines unauthorised access to and modification or imparement of electronic communications as a criminal offence, whilst defining the regulations that allow law enforcement to obtain search and remote access powers during the duration of a search warrent.

2. Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act ( United States of America):

Legislative framework that allows US government agencies and non government entities to share personal information is cases where there has been a cyber attack. Whilst govournment sharing is mandatory, sharing information for non government entities is voluntary. CISA undergoes periodic audits and strict oversight to ensure complience.

3. General Data Protection Regulation (European Union):

The EU general data protection regulation (GDPR) is the strongest privacy and security law in the world. It requires clear notice and consent for all data collection and use, gives users the right to access & modify their personal data, mandatory data breach notification, mandatory assessment of data protection & security measures.

***Q5. List any 5 types of risk associated with cybersecurity in the workplace***

1. Phishing Emails
2. Malware
3. Data theft
4. Ransomware
5. Socially engineered attacks

---

***Q6. Briefly describe and explain the risk associated with a Phishing attack . Answer should be between 50-100 words***

Phishing attacks typically occur via email or text. They are malicious attacks used to deceive individuals into revealing sensitive information.
They may use social engineering tactics to trick people into revealing credentials, financial data and or confidential information.
The risks associated with Phishing attacks include:

- financial losses
- identity theft
- malware infections
- data breaches
- reputational damage
- compromised system security

---

***Q7. Briefly describe and explain the risk associated with a Weak Password . Answer should be between 50-100 words***

A weak password makes accounts a lot more vulnerable, by making it alot easier for attackers to gain unauthorised access to accounts & systems.
An attacker may gain access after using attacks such as Brute Force Attacks, Dictionary Attacks, RainbowTable Attacks and many more.

The risks associated are:

- unauthorized access
- account takeovers
- data breaches
- identity theft
- financial losses
- reputational damage
- potential legal consequences

***Q8. Briefly describe and explain 3 ways to create effective cyber security awareness training in the workplace . Answer should be between 50-100 words.***

To create effective cyber security awareness training in the workplace, consider the following:

***Insident Response Exercises***
> Conduct simulated cyber attacks to test employees response and preparedness, helping to identify vulnerabilities and improve incident response plans.

***Phishing & Identification Training***
> Educate employees to recognise and report phishing attempts, and provide training on how to identify, respond to and report suspicious emails and attachments.

***Update & Review Policies (Governance)***
> Regularly update and review cyber security policies and procedures to ensure they are aligned with the legislative requirements as well as the organisation's governance and compliance requirements. Ensure that employees are made aware of any changes and that training conducted reflect these changes.

***Q9. Identify and briefly explain 4 practices for cybersecurity that should be implemented in the workplace (as recommended by the ACSC). You answer should be between 80 and 160 words.***

The Australian Signals Directorate (ASD), Australian Cyber Security Center (ACSC) recomend the following four practices:

***Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)***
> MFA requires authentication across multiple devices (e.g., Desktop & Mobile) when trying to access your devices or accounts.
> According to ASD, it is one of most effective cyber security measures you can take. This may be in the form of an authenticator app, one time verification SMS code or a physical security key.

***Backup Important Files***
> Backing up files is essential for data recovery in the case of lost, stolen, compromised (malicious software) or damage to data. It is best practice to regularly backup files through a reputable cloud storage provider or by physicaly backing up to an external hard drive or USB storage.

***Use Separate Work / Personal Devices & Accounts***
> Although account synchronisation is a convenient feature that a lot of companies (such as Google & Microsoft) offer, it presents a security risk for sensitive information. If sensitive information gets synchronised on personal devices, it increases the likelihood of the data becoming compromised. To prevent un-authorised access to sensitive information, the ACSC recommends using seperate accounts for offical and personal devices.

***Use Strong, Unique Passwords or Passphrases***
> Use a password manager or passphrases to create strong, unique passwords. While a password manager is convenient and creates a strong unique key, for an account that is accessed frequently and/or on multiple devices, the use of a passphrase creates a strong, memorable password, by combining multiple words.
The ACSC reccomends using at least 4 unrelated words (14 characters or more combined), and not to use popular phrases.

***Q10. Identify and briefly explain 3 reasons why cyber security awareness training for staff is valuable to an organsiation. Answer should be between 50- 100 words.***

***Early Detection***
> By providing cyber security training to employees, they will be able to identify threats and vulnerabilities at the earliest stages, and therefore reduce the harm to the organisation before damage even ocurs.

***Confident Employees***
> Working in a digital environment can be daunting without being knowledgable around how to safely navigate the Internet. By providing training on dection, and mitigation, this will provide all employees the ability to confidently complete their daily duties.

***Reduce Costs***
> By training employees, the risk of data breaches is reduced. This could potentially save companies money as it is cheaper to invest in training than to recover from an incident. This training will not only reduce financial cost factors but also prevent the cost of the organisations reputation.
