# Assessment Task 01

## Answer these questions in a Word Document regarding HTTP and Database Structure

1. **We know that HTTP drives the web however we often do not know what the protocol does. Describe HTTP in your own words.**

- **HTTP/0.9** - `1998 - 1991`

> The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), was originally developed between 1989 - 1991 as part of the 'World Wide Web' project as way for Nuclear Scientist within Europe belonging to the research organisation 'CERN' to share documents and data over the Internet. The very first version (`HTTP/0.9`) only contained the `GET` method that allowed users to retrieve HTML pages.

- **HTTP/1.0** - `1996`

> When HTTP/1.0 was developed, it introduced the standardisation of response codes, introduced headers and brought more methods such as `POST` & `HEAD`. This allowed users to communicate between clients with ease for the first time.

- **HTTP/1.1 & HTTPS** - `1997 - 2014`

> The introduction to HTTP/1.1 changed the way people used the Internet so drastically, that it became the default standard for 18 years. Although HTTP was the default version of HTTP communication, there were growing concerns in the mid 1990's about how secure data was whilst being transmitted via the HyperText Transfer Protocol, which led to the development of the HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) which combined Transfer Layer Security (TLS) (formerly known as SSL, Secure Sockets Layer) to encrypt data transferred between client and server. Although this change in protocol became essential for protecting sensitive information being passed via the Internet, it wouldn't become wide adopted until between the 2000's  2010's.
