# Assessment Task 01

## Answer these questions in a Word Document regarding HTTP and Database Structure

1. **We know that HTTP drives the web however we often do not know what the protocol does. Describe HTTP in your own words.**

- **HTTP/0.9** - `1998 - 1991`

> The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), was originally developed in 1989 as part of the 'World Wide Web' project as way for Nuclear Scientist within Europe belonging to the research organisation 'CERN' to share documents and data over the Internet. The very first version (`HTTP/0.9`) was released in 1991 which only contained the `GET` method that allowed users to retrieve HTML pages.

- **HTTP/1.0** - `1996`

> Between 1991 - 1995, the protocol was operated with a try-and-see approach. Interoperability issues were quite common, so as an effort to address and solve these issues, an informational document known as [RFC 1945](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1945) was produced, that described the first set of common rules and practices when publishing and transmitting via HTTP. This lead to the development of HTTP/1.0 which introduced the standardisation of response codes, introduced headers and brought more methods such as `POST` & `HEAD`. This gave users the ability communicate between clients with ease for the first time ensuring that information was resolved at each end.

- **HTTP/1.1 & HTTPS** - `1997 - 2014`

> After to the initiation of standardisation in HTTP/1.0, HTTP had brought many new rules and guides, in order to clarify ambiguities, this lead to the development of HTTP/1.1, which also implemented numerous improvements like;

- The ability to reuse a connection, which meant that it no longer needed to open multimedia multiple times to display resources and embeddings.
- Pipelining was introduced, allowing a second request to be sent before the response.
- Support for chunked responses.
- Additional cache control systems were introduced.
- Content negotiation, including encoding and type, giving client & server a way to resolve content that would have conflicted when exchanged.
- The `HOST` header allowed servers to host multiple domains on the one IP address.

HTTP/1.1 would be officially released in 1997 as [RFC 2068](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2068)

Although HTTP/1.1 was the standardised protocol, there were growing concerns around how secure data was whilst being transmitted. This lead to the development of the HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) which combined Transfer Layer Security (TLS) (formerly known as SSL, Secure Sockets Layer) to encrypt data transferred between client and server. Although this change in protocol became essential for protecting sensitive information being passed via the Internet, it wouldn't become widely adopted until the late 2000's to mid 2010's.

- describe the process for developing small-size applications

- identify and outline the key features of a graphical user interface (GUI), for interaction with
an operator.

6. **Include APA references for all your answers, even if you know the answer. Your answers will need to be backed up by reference information of another source.**
