# Context and Considerations for UI/UX Modularisation

## Overview

In this exercise, you will think critically about how to split the UI/UX of our application to make it more efficient and user-friendly. You will be guided through a set of steps that will lead you to modularise the code into `domUpdate`, `eventHandler` modules, and a `Post` class.

## Steps and Considerations

### 1. Understanding the Current State

First, review the current state of the application. Open the HTML and JavaScript files and understand how the UI elements and event handlers are currently managed.

**Questions to Consider:**

- How are different parts of the UI organised in the HTML?
- How is the JavaScript code interacting with the HTML elements?
- What are the key functionalities that users interact with?

### 2. Identifying Reusable Components

Think about the parts of the UI that can be separated into reusable components. For instance, buttons with similar functionalities, sections of the page that could be dynamically generated, etc.

**Questions to Consider:**

- Which parts of the UI are repeated or have similar structures?
- Can any of these parts be abstracted into a function or a class?

### 3. Event Handling

Event handling is a crucial part of any interactive application. Consider how you can separate the logic for handling events (like clicks, hovers, double-clicks) from the UI elements themselves.

**Questions to Consider:**

- What events are being handled in the current application?
- How can you abstract event handling logic into a separate module?

### 4. DOM Manipulation

Manipulating the DOM is necessary for updating the UI based on user interactions. Think about how you can separate the logic for updating the DOM into its own module.

**Questions to Consider:**

- What DOM updates are being made in response to user interactions?
- How can you create functions that encapsulate these updates?

### 5. Creating a `Post` Class

In applications where you need to manage structured data like blog posts, having a class to represent these entities can be very useful. This allows you to encapsulate both data and related methods.

**Questions to Consider:**

- What data and behaviours are associated with a post in your application?
- How can you create a class that encapsulates this data and behaviour?

### 6. Modularising the Code

Based on your answers to the previous steps, start modularising the code. Create separate files for handling events, updating the DOM, and defining the `Post` class.

**Questions to Consider:**

- How will you organise your modules to keep the code clean and maintainable?
- How will these modules interact with each other?

## Example Approach

### Event Handling Module (`eventHandlers.js`)

This module will contain functions that handle various user interactions like clicks, hovers, and double-clicks.

### DOM Manipulation Module (`domManipulation.js`)

This module will contain functions that update the DOM, such as adding new posts or updating UI elements based on user actions.

### `Post` Class (`post.js`)

This class will represent a blog post, encapsulating data like title and content, and providing methods to create and manage post elements.

By splitting the code into these modules, you will achieve a more organised, maintainable, and scalable application. This approach also follows the principles of separation of concerns, making it easier to understand and modify individual parts of the application without affecting the whole system.

## Conclusion

By carefully considering how to modularise the UI/UX of your application, you can significantly improve the user experience and maintainability of your code. Follow the steps above, answer the questions, and implement your modularised solution.
