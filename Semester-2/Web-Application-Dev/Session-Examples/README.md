# Web Application Development Classes

Sessions will include lecture material & coding challenges. We provide base content for you to use in your learning.

## Setting Up Your Code Environment

To allow us to use all of the packages and tools we might need, we need to set up our code environment:

1. **Open Laragon:**
2. Open the terminal (ensure you are in the `www` folder) then type the following commands:

   ```bash
   mkdir source
   cd source
   mkdir repos
   cd repos
   ```

3. Clone the class content into the folder using:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NM-TAFE/dip-web-application-development-classes.git
   ```

4. Navigate back to the `www` folder:

   ```bash
   cd ../../
   ```

5. Check that npm is installed:

   ```bash
   npm -v
   ```

6. Install the latest version:

   ```bash
   npm install -g npm@latest
   ```

7. Check the installation worked (if updates are required):

   ```bash
   npm -v
   ```

8. Clone the GitHub repository with the following command in your Laragon terminal:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NM-TAFE/dip-web-application-development-classes.git
   ```

9. To get weekly updates, use:

   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

## GitHub Repository

**[NM-TAFE/dip-web-application-development-classes](https://github.com/NM-TAFE/dip-web-application-development-classes):** Repository for challenges and code examples for ICTWEB517 & ICTPRG546 (beginning 2024).

Note: You can also download the session code in the Blackboard shell.
