// TODO: In this challenge, a farmer is asking you to tell him how many
//       legs can be counted among all his animals. The farmer breeds
//       three species of animal/bird:
//          chickens = 2 legs
//          cows = 4 legs
//          pigs = 4 legs
//      The farmer has counted his animals and he gives you a subtotal
//      for each species.
//      You have to implement a function that returns the total number
//      of legs of all the animals.
