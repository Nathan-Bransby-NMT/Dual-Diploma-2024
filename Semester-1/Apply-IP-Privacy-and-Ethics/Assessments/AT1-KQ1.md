> 
> - **Here are some of the following codes adopted by the ITPA;**
> 
> > **1. Fair Treatment** :
> > Ensures that everybody is treated fairly as equals without discrimination based on personal attributes such as age, disability, sexual preferences, etc.
> 
> > **2. Privacy** : This governs that anyone with access to private digital information is restricted to gaining access when it is not necessary in the line of their duties. Failure to comply could result in action being taken for breaching the statutory laws governing data such as the Australian Privacy Principles.
> 
> > **3. Communication** : The obligation to inform users about any changes or disruptions that may affect them.
> 
> > **4. System Integrity** - System Integrity ensures that employees and professionals in the ICT industry make an effort to keep up to date with current threats and applying the current leading cyber security practices when setting up networks and computer systems.
>>
>> System integrity also refers to ensuring you have a well thought out UI/UX, accessability and maintainability whilst keeping the primary stakeholders in mind.
> 
> > **5. Social Responsibility** : The professional will keep up to date with social and legal issues ensuring their understanding is ethically aligned with the current laws and policies in ICT.
