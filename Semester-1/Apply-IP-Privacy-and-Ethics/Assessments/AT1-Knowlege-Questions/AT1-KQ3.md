  In order to safeguard intellectual property (IP), an organisation in the ICT industry must adhere to all legislation in place for IP Protection, such as the Copyright Act 1968 and the Privacy Act 1988 for data protection in order to respect peoples IP and privacy.
  
  The established organisational communication processes should include information such as propriety information, patents, copyrights and trademarks. 
  
  In Australia, organisations must have well-documented and detailed workplace policies and procedural practices that help uphold these policies.
  Once finalized, these policies are communicated to all employees through training sessions, company intranet, and regular updates to ensure awareness and understanding.
  Employees that don't comply could result in legal action being taken on the individual.
  
  Regular training programs are essential to ensure that employees understand the importance of these policies and how to implement them. Workshops, online courses, and seminars are used to educate staff about their responsibilities, the legal implications of breaches, and best practices for maintaining compliance.

  Having clear reporting structure is essential for organisations to manage any data breaches or ethical concerns. It is important that organisations make all employees aware on how to report potential violations which can be done anonymously if necessary. The organization must have a procedure for investigating and addressing these reports, ideally by a third party organisation to ensure a non-biasness. The results obtained from a formal investigation should include disciplinary actions for non-compliance, which might involve coordination between HR, legal, and IT departments to ensure a fair and thorough investigation.

  Finally, the policies and procedures should be reviewed regularly and be updated in response to any new laws,major technological advances, and results obtained from internal audit findings. Feedback from employees and other stakeholders are also essential for organisations to refine these policies to ensure they remain effective and relevant.
