### <u>Notes</u>

- #### Q1
  
  _**Relation of Code of Ethics to the IP & Copyright Policy.**_
  
  ```.txt
  The Code of Ethics promotes principles such as integrity, fairness, and respect, which are fundamental in establishing IP requirements. These ethical guidelines ensure that all personnel act honestly and transparently, respecting the IP rights of others and avoiding conflicts of interest. The emphasis on compliance with laws and regulations in the Code of Ethics supports adherence to copyright laws and IP protection measures outlined in the IP & Copyright Policy. This ethical framework fosters a culture of accountability and responsibility, ensuring that IP is managed and protected in a fair and lawful manner.
