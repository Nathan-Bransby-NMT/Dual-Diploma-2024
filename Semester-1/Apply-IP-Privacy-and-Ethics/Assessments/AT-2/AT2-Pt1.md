# IP, Ethics & Privacy <br> Assessment Task-2: _Activity-1_

`Attempt-1`
---

## Question 1

- **How does the Code of Ethics influence the establishment of IP requirements in the organisation? (80 to 100 words)**

  ```.txt
  The Code of Ethics influences the establishment of IP requirements by promoting principles such as integrity, fairness, and respect, which are fundamental when establishing IP requirements. These ethical guidelines ensure that all personnel act with honestly and transparency, respecting the IP rights of others and avoiding conflicts of interest. 
  
  The emphasis on compliance with laws and regulations in the Code of Ethics promotes the copyright laws and IP protection measures that are outlined in the IP & Copyright Policy. This encourages a culture of accountability and responsibility, ensuring that IP is managed and protected in a fair and lawful manner.

## Question 2

  ```.txt
  1. Enhanced Digital Rights Management :
   
  With the increasing use of digital platforms, the policy should include robust guidelines for digital rights management to prevent unauthorized distribution and use of digital content. This ensures compliance with recent legislation on digital copyright protection.

  2. Enhanced Data Privacy Integration : 
  
  Integrate more robust data privacy measures within the IP and copyright policies. With new data protection laws, this change ensures that personal data involved in IP creation and management is protected, aligning with both ethical standards and recent legislative requirements.
