  ```.txt
  The Code of Ethics influences the establishment of IP requirements by promoting principles such as integrity, fairness, and respect, which are all fundamental when establishing IP requirements. These ethical guidelines ensure that all personnel act with honestly and transparency, respecting the IP rights of others and avoiding conflicts of interest. 
  
  The emphasis on compliance with laws and regulations in the Code of Ethics document promotes the copyright laws and IP protection measures that are outlined in the IP & Copyright Policy. This encourages a culture of accountability and responsibility, ensuring that IP is managed and protected in a fair and lawful manner.
