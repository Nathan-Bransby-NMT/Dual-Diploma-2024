# Shire of Chittering -- Solution Report

## 1. Executive Summary

## 2. Overview

> In response to the Shire of Chittering, our team has been tasked with developing an application that will act as centralized platform for the residents within the Chittering Region. As discussed with CEO Malinda Prinsloo, there is a need for more effective announcements to residents about upcoming events, a more cost effective solution for sending important alerts and a need for making payments to the Shire for Services and Rates more accessible to all residents.

### 2.1. Stakeholders

  > **The application contains the following stakeholders:**
  > 1. The Residents within the Shire of Chittering.
  > 2. The Staff within the Shire of Chittering.
  >   - Shire CEO -- Melinda Prinsloo
  >   - Emergency Service Coordinator -- Jodie Connell
  >   - Shire Rates Department & Staff.
  > 3. Our Team, developing the application.
  >   - Bianca Ishikawa
  >   - Douglas Ferguson
  >   - Daniel Mulenga
  >   - Nathan Bransby (Myself)
  >   - Sangay Thinley
  >   - Yang Lim
  > 4. North Metropolitan TAFE
  >   - Project Supervisor -- Aaron Clifford


## 3. Business Requirements

- ### 3.1. High Level Objectives / Use-Cases

    > After our first meeting with Shire CEO -- Melinda Prinsloo & Emergency Service Coordinator -- Jodie Connell, several crucial elements emerged that are fundamental for the final application.
    >
    >
    > >_[Note: the following objectives will be referred to throughout the document:]_
    > >
    >
    > #### _A._ **Rate Payment System** --
    >
    >
    >     This objective is the most crucial, Melinda Prinsloo has highlighted the need to provide functionality that allows residents in the Chittering Region to view and make payments on their annual property rates from within the application.
    >
    > #### _B._ **Events & Community News** --
    >
    >     Previously, residents in the region have spoken about how they weren't aware of events being held in the townsite of Bindoon. Despite many different approaches to uplift announcements there is still a need to maximise the outreach of news and events. As discussed in our meeting with the Shire on the 28ᵗʰ March 2024, Melinda mentioned that they require a central hub for the local community to receive news about upcoming events. This will help to provide an equal opportunity for those who live more remote than others, to be able to hear announcements on events and information.
    >
    > #### _C._ **Emergency Alerts & Broadcasts** --
    >
    >     Emergency Service Coordinator, Jodie Connell has expressed the importance of getting bushfire information and alerts out to the community in a timely efficient manner. With the vast rural area being abound by natural bushland, bushfires happen frequently throughout the bushfire season. In response to harsh conditions (such as high UV forecasts), the Shire will impose Harvest-Ban and / or Total-Fire-Ban days under the instruction from the Department of Fire and Emergency Services (DFES). 
    >
    >       ɪ. We have been tasked with creating a way to broadcast alerts whenever restrictions are in effect to users who are subscribed to the service. There is an importance to develop a creative solution for alerts to reach those in mobile "black-spot" areas as it is critical information that can carry offenses if not obeyed.
    >
    >      ɪɪ. The final application also needs to display the current Fire Danger Rating (FDR) system for the Swan Inland North section. !!TODO: mention previous group progress!!
    >
    >     ɪɪɪ. Depending on the time constraints in the projects developmental stage, the Shire has also expressed an interest to have a display showing active bushfire alerts affecting the area and essential information for new residents regarding their responsibility and requirements in maintaining fire breaks for key inspections dates.

- ### 3.2. Relation to Strategic Plan
  
  As per the Shire of Chittering's Strategic plan, they have developed the following five strategic objectives that stem from their core community aspirations: &#160;&#187;&#160;&#160;<small>[<u>see below</u>: <a href="#figure-D"><u><b><i>figure</b></u>&#8202;<b>ᴰ</b></i></a>]</small>

## 6. Possible Solutions

 ### 6.a. -- Solution #1

    In order to address the requirements being asked by the Shire of Chittering, I propose that we adhere to these following solution that cover the key objectives below:

        - I.   | Rates Payment System
        - II.  | Events & Community News
        - III. | Emergency Alerts & Broadcasts

    > Section I. Rates Payment System:
      
      To implement an effective system that benefits both residents and Shire staff, I propose the implementation of a self 
      service portal that allows residents to: 

          - Make property rate payments, select appropriate installment period options.
          - View any outstanding rates for the financial year.
          - Get notified when rates are issues and/or due.
          - Change payment details / options.
      
      In order to enhance security when requesting property payments and other sensitive information, I propose the following 
      solutions:

          - Users Create a one time account registry 
          - Account information will be tied with each property's unique reference number and name of the addressee that can be 
            found on the issued rate notice.
          - Users will create passwords with email verification upon registering.
            - This allows for account recovery incase details are lost.
          - Information on account creation WILL be encrypted using Industry Best Practices & Standards when stored account
            info. 
          - Once encrypted the details can be stored in the current database with only slight amendments to the current table,
            however if the need arises, the creation of an individual database can be created.
            
            **Note:**
              Alterations WILL NOT impact how the current information is stored or accessed by the rates department & systems.

    > Section II. Events & Community News:

      An additional requirement of the application being developed is the 


    > Section III. Emergency Alerts & Broadcasts:

- ### 6.1. Business Impacts

  #### 6.1.1. **Solution - #1**

    - **S1.A.  Rates Payment System**

        By implementing a built in rates payment & query system into the application, it will ease staff workload by enabling residents to access rates services without the need of staff. This overall will increase customer support satisfaction, and increase staff productivity.

        ??Shire Staff Training & Community "How To" workshops and material??

      ---

    - **S1.B. Events & Community News**

        Creating a central hub for community information, will increase attendance of events, therefore help boost local economy by encouraging residents to engage within the community. By fostering a platform, a space is created for local advertisement opportunities.

      ---

    - **S1.C. Emergency Alerts & Broadcasts**

        By implementing in-app broadcast alert system, the Shire may be able to phase out of their current Emergency Broadcast system that is implemented by Telstra Integrated Messaging System (TIMS). TIMS is not a cost effective solution as each broadcast costs upwards of $1500 _[see [figure E](#figure-e)]_.

        Ensuring that residents are made aware of active restrictions can reduce the number of emergency events through effective compliance. This ensures that there are less business interruptions throughout the year.

- ### 6.2. Implementation Constraints

  #### 6.2.1. **Solution - #1**

    - **S1.A.  Rates Payment System**

        * Accessing existing database and making alterations to help secure / create user accounts.
        * Residents support of the changing system may need some encouragement as the median age of residents are above the age of 40 so their acceptance of a technology based approach may be lower than the latter.
        * Potential time constraints of implementing such a system may impact our ability to deliver all requirements.

      ---

    - **S1.B. Events & Community News**

        * The ability for local businesses to uttilise the platform without engaging the shire may decrease its effectiveness
