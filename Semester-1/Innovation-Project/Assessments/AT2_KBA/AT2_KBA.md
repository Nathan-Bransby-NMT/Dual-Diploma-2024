## 1. List two brainstorming techniques to generate ideas
  
    1. Mind Map
    2. Starbursting

---

## 2. Discuss techniques to identify the suitability of an idea for implementation within a project. How might an idea or possible solution be evaluated?

    Implement an Agile Workflow - To ensure that periodic evaluation is being conducted.

    Create measurable objectives to work towards & make sure the requirements are SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant & Time Based)

    Conduct a Gap-analysis on the current system, and ensure that the objectives are intended to closing any of the gaps highlighted.
    
    Get feedback from the primary stakeholders and adjust your methods according to their vision.

---

## 3. Describe a practical or operational reason a project might not proceed

    Finance - 
    
    An example where a project might not proceed could be due to lack of funds or financial interest from the client.

---

## 4. Describe effective methods of evaluating solutions of systems against a business and its objectives

    1. Conduct a Cost Benefit Analysis - to determine if the solution is worth pursuing financially for the business.
    2. Conduct a Risk Analysis - determines what the potential risks involved are and how they can avoid them.

## 5. Describe in your own words two emerging trends or technologies in your field and how they impact it

### A) **Blockchain Authentication**

    Blockchain Authentication is a technology that aims to replace traditional (Two-Factor-Authentication/Multi-Factor-Authentication) by incorporating decentralised blockchain networks to authenticate user sign-in attempts, without the need of third party Centralised/Federate Identity Management Systems (IMS) – like Google, Amazon, Facebook. IMS's allow for bulk collection and storage of personal information & sensitive user data, which can potentially put user's at risk of data theft whilst also allowing for a single point of failure.

    The risks involved in Blockchain Authentication are greatly reduced by cryptographically storing users information in directly in their wallets which can only obtainable if the user signs the transaction using an end-to-end public/private key system. After verifying & transacting the request, the only data that gets stored in the blockchain ledger, is the issuer's public cryptographic key as a safety measure, to verify the that the request is legitimate.

### B) Large Language Model Artificial Intelligence

    Large Language Model AI (LLMs) are large deep learning models pre trained to comprehend and generate human language text. One of the main ways that they are impacting the IT industry is by replacing the need of hiring customer support help desk responders, instead companies are able to deploy LLMs to respond and generate to low level tickets, filtering out the mid-high level tickets and assigning then to staff to address.

## 7. List two example sections that could be included in an action plan document and describe their purpose

    1. **Project timeline**: Lists all of the key milestones that the project needs to achieve within expected time-frames. This is used to clearly display the different stages of development.

    2. **Risk management plan**: Identifies and assesses potential risks that could, negatively impact the success of the project. An important function of a Risk management plan is the mitigation of risks through the development of risk reduction strategies.
