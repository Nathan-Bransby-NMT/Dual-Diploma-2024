## 1. List two brainstorming techniques to generate ideas
  
    1. Mind Map
    2. Starbursting

---

## 2. Discuss techniques to identify the suitability of an idea for implementation within a project. How might an idea or possible solution be evaluated?

    Create measurable objectives to work towards & make sure the requirements are SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant & Time Based)
    
    ---
    - Feedback:
        * A clear way to identify if the idea is suitable for implementation. (positive = good, neg = bad)

## 3. Describe a practical or operational reason a project might not proceed

    Financial reasoning - An example where a project might not proceed could be due to lack of funds or financial interest to continue to pursue .

---

## 4. Describe effective methods of evaluating solutions of systems against a business and its objectives

    Cost benifit analysis
    risk analysis

    ---
    ---
    1. Thinking through possible solutions.
    2. Determining what's feasible.
    3. Figuring out what's practical. 
    ---

## 5. Describe in your own words two emerging trends or technologies in your field and how they impact it

### A) **Blockchain Authentication**

    Blockchain Authentication is a technology that aims to replace traditional (Two-Factor-Authentication/Multi-Factor-Authentication) by incorporating decentralised blockchain networks to authenticate user sign-in attempts, without the need of third party Centralised/Federate Identity Management Systems (IMS) – like Google, Amazon, Facebook. IMS's allow for bulk collection and storage of personal information & sensitive user data, which can potentially put user's at risk of data theft whilst also allowing for a single point of failure.

    The risks involved in Blockchain Authentication are greatly reduced by cryptographically storing users information in directly in their wallets which can only obtainable if the user signs the transaction using an end-to-end public/private key system. After verifying & transacting the request, the only data that gets stored in the blockchain ledger, is the issuer's public cryptographic key as a safety measure, to verify the that the request is legitimate.

## 6. Identify an existing product or service that would allow this technology or trend to be implemented in a project. (Also provide evidence as links and screenshots of those services)

### A) Wallet Connect - (One-Click Authentication) `June 12 2024`

## 7. List two example sections that could be included in an action plan document and describe their purpose.
    1. **Project timeline**: Lists all of the key milestones that the project needs to achieve within expected time-frames. This is used to clearly display the different stages of development.

    2. **Risk management plan**: Identifies and assesses potential risks that could, negatively impact the success of the project. An important function of a Risk management plan is the mitigation of risks through the development of risk reduction strategies.
