# Innovation Project (Part-1) AT2-KBA

### 1. List two brainstorming techniques to generate ideas.
    1. Mind Map
    2. Starbursting

### 2. Discuss techniques to identify the suitability of an idea for implementation within a project. How might an idea or possible solution be evaluated?
    - Create measurable objectives to work towards & make sure the requirements are SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant & Time Based)
    ---
    - Feedback:
        * A clear way to identify if the idea is suitable for implementation. (possitive = good, neg = bad)
    ---

### 3. Describe a practical or operational reason a project might not proceed.
    - Financial reasoning - An example where a project might not proceed could be due to lack of funds or financial interest by the client.

### 4. Describe effective methods of evaluating solutions of systems against a business and its objectives.`
    ---
    Cost benifit analysis
    risk analysis

    ---
    ---
    1. Thinking through possible solutions.
    2. Determining what's feasible.
    3. Figuring out what's practical. 
    ---

### 5. Describe in your own words two emerging trends or technologies in your field and how they impact it.
    ---
    **Blockchain Authentication**:
      Blockchain Authentication is a technology that harnesses decentralised blockchain networks to authenticate user sign-in attempts, without the need of third party infrastructure & services. 
      
      As the commonly utilised digital identity management tools allow for bulk collection and storage of sensitive user data, this can make them vulnerable to data theft and other cyber crimes. 

      ######
      
       system model, allows   authentication  impacts  removes the need for account sign-in credential storage, MFA/2FA, enhances security & privacy.

### 6. Identify an existing product or service that would allow this technology or trend to be implemented in a project. (Also provide evidence as links and screenshots of those services)

** example: stripe => product / service [#5]**

### 7. List two example sections that could be included in an action plan document and describe their purpose.
    1. **Project timeline**: Lists key milestones that the project needs to achieve within expected time-frames.

    2. **Risk management plan**: Identifies and assesses potential risks that could, negatively impact the success of the project. An important function of a Risk management plan is the mitigation of risks through the development of risk reduction strategies.
