# Douglas - 2/4/24

## Background

- Shire of Chittering has been working with North Metro TAFE Diploma students for 3 years.
	- A previous TAFE Diploma team worked on a website recreation.
	- A previous TAFE Diploma team worked on the first app, in Xamarin?
		- This is the current iteration on the Google Play Store.
		- Many features disabled in the play store deployment.
	- A third Advanced Programming student team
### The problem
- Sending announcements to the community is cost prohibitive. 
- Facilitating rates payments and enquiries is time consuming for shire receptionists and administrators.
- Community not big on social media.
	- "I'm not on Facebook" - shire resident.
### Business Requirements
- Potentially working with sensitive data and private information.
- Solutions should align with the Shire's Corporate Business Plan.
- Being already rather fragmented before it's launch, and an ongoing project with TAFE, solutions should be scalable, extendable, and easy to maintain for future students.
- Avoid where possible, *vendor lock-in*, such as in the case of CouncilConnect and their current Council Management Software. Solutions that support open standards (e.g. WordPress), and are more platform agnostic, may help the Shire keep costs low by:
	- Having a much wider array of available support options,
	- Negotiating better deals on hosting fees,
	as they are not limited to a single managed service provider.
- Notifications can be of high importance and time critical. Cellular network coverage is not great, there may be black spots in the area. Testing will be critical to success.
- Previous communication with students may have been inconsistent, we want to make regular communication a priority.
### Business Objectives
- Paying my council rates is quick and easy.
	- I can view my outstanding rates balance using the Shire of Chittering mobile app.
	- I can pay my council rates using the mobile app.
	- I am notified via the mobile app when my rates are due.
- Communicating with community is quick and easy.
	- Sending community announcements is quick and easy.
	- I only have to make community announcements in one place.
	- I am notified via the mobile app when the council makes an announcement.
