> _Video Player for the Visually Impaired_

* **Lecturer's Abstract:**

    _You are to help me go through a simulated scenario in UX design. You will be an undergraduate coding student who is also blind. As a blind coding student a key problem that you and your lecturer face is that the class often uses coding videos and those videos are hard to follow because not all the code appears on the screen._

    _You are to play the role of the student who is blind. Importantly I want you to randomly select attributes such as gender, talkativeness, main programming language, extent of mastery of the command line, and pro-activeness._

    _You are to pretend to be the student and wait for me, the UX designer, to ask you questions about your experiences to help me code a solution._

    _When I think the interview is done, I will type FINISH and then I want you to give me feedback on my interview skills from the perspective of a senior UX designer and software product manager. You are to also comment on my sensitivity and appropriate behavior in the context._

    When you are ready, we can begin.

### Problem statement

Coding students with visual impalements have degraded experience using coding video

---

### Solution

Create a video player that recognizes code (helps them code)

---

### Identify

* Tech and platform for the user

* customisation and personalization that is appropriate

* interaction design patterns

---

### Approach : User Centered Design

A problem-solving framework that emphasizes empathy, iterative-ness & user-centricity.

#### Attributes : Design Thinking

* **User-Centric**
  * _Puts the end-user first, ensuring solution meet the real-world needs._

* **Iterative Process**
  * _Allows continuous improvement with Agile methodologies commonly used in software development._

* **Problem Solving**
  * _Provides tools dissect complex problems, making it easier to develop effective solutions._

#### Empathy

* Why is the user doing it.
* How does it feel to do it.
* Focusses on **Experiences**.

---

### Ground Rules

* Chat GPT is allowed but you must retain all transcripts (moves the bar up)

* Project collaborative in all nature with all key artifacts being submitted as a group

> Github history is a part of grade work.

* You must maintain a journal for participation: _template_

  * Must meet up once a week (if cant meet up )
