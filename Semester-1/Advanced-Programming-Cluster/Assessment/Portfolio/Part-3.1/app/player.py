        Performs an Argon2 hash function on a password provided, returning a tuple containing 
        a new PasswordHasher object and the encoded result of the provided password after being 
        hashed.

        Note:
            The following method is created as a static method to act as a general function. 
            This helps to ensure that the private instance attributes containg player's credentials 
            remain unchanged unless being assigned during the new instance of a player or upon 
            password verification.

            After successful authentication both the stored hashed password and the PasswordHasher 
            private attributes are reassigned as a best practice to ensure the integrity of securing 
            user credentials.

        Args:
            password (str): The provided password being hashed.

            password.
