# Advanced Programming | _(Portfolio Assessment - Pt.3)_

## Step-1 _(Knowledge Based)_

**In your own words, describe what sorting is in general.**

_Sorting is the act of returning a collection of items in a specific order by using a sorting algorithm._

## Step-2 _(Knowledge Based)_

**Research sorting algorithms. Describe advantages and disadvantages for at least three different sorting algorithms. Please provide references for external resources.**

1. _..._
2. _..._
3. _..._

## Step-3 _(Knowledge Based)_

**In your own words, describe why you generally need comparison operators to successfully sort a list of objects.**

**In addition, describe how you could sort a list of objects without adding comparison operators.**

_..._

## Step-4

_**In this step, you will be sorting a list of player objects based on their score. This step has multiple parts to it.**_

a. **Add a private instance variable to the Player class that will hold the score (a positive integer value).Provide a getter (property) and a setter method for this value.** `...done`

b. **Implement the comparison operators ``__eq__``, ``__ge__``, etc.) for the Player class. Implement each so that the comparison uses the score.**  `...done`

c. **Add unit tests to test the new operators.** `...done`

d. **Implement a static method for the Player class that will sort a list of Player objects in descending order (higher scores come first). Choose an algorithm of your liking based on the answers you provided to the Knowledge Questions and describe why you chose it.  IMPORTANT: you must implement this algorithm yourself; you may not use Pythonâ€™s sort method.** `todo`

e. **Add unit tests to test the new sorting functionality.** `todo`

f. **Add and commit all changes, then push your changes to the remote repository on GitHub.** `todo`
