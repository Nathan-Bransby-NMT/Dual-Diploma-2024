Issues and ideas:

- issues with code capturing when video screen is split
- IDE feature does not seem work
- key option for capturing frame and pausing video
- button and key for copying captured code to clipboard
- capture code only (ignore line numbers, file name etc.)
- integrate screen reader to read code (and add button and key option to activate)
- add pagination for code captures (instead of the current scrollable display)

Possible user stories:

- As a user, when there are other elements in the video, I'd like to capture code only, so that I can copy and paste it into my IDE.

- As a user, I'd like to paginate between captured codes, so that I can use the screen reader with them in a more accessible way.

- As a visual impaired user, I'd like to activate the screen reader on the extracted code, so that I can access the content in audio form.

- As a user, I'd like to extract code from screenshot, so that I can access the code the quicker and easier.(multiple websites / wider range from media)

- As a user, I'd like to extract code from video, so that I can open the code in clipboard.

- As a user, I'd like to extract code from video, so that I can open the code in IDE.

- As a user, I'd like to extract code from video, so that I can open the code in screen reader.
