# Writing an effective Cover Letter

## How to Structure

A good cover letter follows the following simple formula that you can apply to every single job you apply for:

1. <u><b>Who?</b></u> - Who you are. Easy enough.

2. <u><b>Where?</b></u> - Where you're coming from, _(i.e., College, Industry, etc.)_

3. <u><b>Why?</b></u> - Why you're interested in this company, and show that you researched them.

4. <u><b>What?</b></u> - What you can bring to the table.

5. <u><b>When</b></u> - When you're available to start, and when they can contact you.

6. <u><b>How</b></u> - How they can reach you.

### Example Cover-Letter

I am very interested in working for [company name] and can start [when you can start]. Your commitment to [company value] and [another company value] that I saw on the website inspired me!
